# Gravity Simulation

## An Introduction

As both a computer science and physics student, I have taken many physics classes throughout my educational journey and have noticed the difficulties educators encounter when trying to teach conceptually-difficult concepts to a wide variety of students with different prefered learning styles. This personal project attempts to help visual-learners in introductory physics courses better grasp the concept of how the curving of spacetime by heavy masses translates to gravity. The core idea behind this application is to have saved "Simulations", where each Simulation is a playground for students to experiment with how masses in space effect oneanother and the spacetime around them. To do so, students will be able to add "Objects" (each with a mass and initial velocity) to a Simulation and see how the Objects effect oneanother gravitationally. Furthermore, students should be able to change between "Reference Frames" of Objects in each Simulaiton to better grasp the idea behind relativity and relativistic (potentially) addition of velocities. Finally, if there is time (as this part is quite ambitious), I would like each simulation to have a 2D "Grid" which represents spacetime. Thus when a student adds an Object to their Simulation, the object should warp the grid just as a planet would warp spacetime.
